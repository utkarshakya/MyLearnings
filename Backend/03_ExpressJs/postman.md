# Postman What and Why?

Postman is a popular API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test, and document APIs. It is available as a desktop application and as a Chrome extension.

## Why We Use Postman

1. **API Testing**: It allows developers to test API endpoints by sending requests and viewing responses.
2. **Debugging**: Helps in identifying issues with API requests and responses.
3. **Automation**: Supports automated testing of APIs.
4. **Documentation**: Can generate and share API documentation.
5. **Collaboration**: Teams can share collections of API requests and responses.

In simple words, Postman is a tool that helps developers interact with APIs and understand how they work. We can make POST, GET, PUT, DELETE requests and see the response.
