# How Express Makes Things Simple for Us

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building server-side applications by providing a set of tools and utilities that streamline common tasks.

## Simplifying Aspects of Express

1. **Routing:**
   Express makes it easy to define routes for your application. You can handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and define route handlers in a clean and organized way.

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello World!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

2. **Middleware:**
   Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. Express provides a simple way to use and chain middleware functions.

   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {

   console.log('Time:', Date.now());
   next();
   });
   ```

3. **Error Handling:**
    Express provides a way to handle errors that occur during the execution of your application. You can define error-handling middleware functions that take four arguments (err, req, res, next) to handle errors in a centralized way.
  
    ```javascript
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
      console.error(err.stack);
      res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
    });
    ```

4. **Static Files:**
    Express makes it easy to serve static files (such as images, CSS, JavaScript) by using the `express.static` middleware function.

    ```javascript
    app.use(express.static('public'));
    ```
