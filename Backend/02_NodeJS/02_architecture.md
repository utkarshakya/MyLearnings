# Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## Monolithic Architecture

In a monolithic architecture, all the components of an application are bundled together into a single unit. This means that the user interface, business logic, and data access layers are all part of one large codebase.

**Example:**
Imagine you have an online store application. In a monolithic architecture, the entire application (product catalog, user management, order processing, payment processing) is built as a single, unified application. If you need to update the payment processing logic, you have to redeploy the entire application.

## Microservices Architecture

In a microservices architecture, the application is divided into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other. Each service is responsible for a specific piece of functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

**Example:**
Using the same online store example, in a microservices architecture, the application would be broken down into separate services:

- A Product Service for managing the product catalog
- A User Service for managing user accounts
- An Order Service for handling orders
- A Payment Service for processing payments

Each of these services can be developed and deployed independently. If you need to update the payment processing logic, you only need to redeploy the Payment Service, not the entire application.

### Summary

- **Monolithic Architecture:** All-in-one application, tightly coupled components.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Independent, loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific functionality.
