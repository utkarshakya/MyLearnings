>> RECURSION QUESTS (Some don't use recursion)

questRecursion01.c = WAP to make a function to calculate the combination of given value of n and r.
questRecursion02.c = WAP to print pascal triangle using functions.
questRecursion03.c = WAP to print no. of element of fibonacci series for n terms.
questRecursion04.c = WAP to print no. from 1 to n in increasing order.
questRecursion05.c = WAP to print no. from 1 to n in decreasing order.
questRecursion06.c = WAP to print sum from 1 to n.
questRecursion07.c = WAP to calculate the a^b (a raise to the power b).
questRecursion08.c = WAP to find the nth fibonacci number.
questRecursion09.c = WAP for stair case (Max 2 Jumps).
questRecursion10.c = WAP for stair case (Max 3 Jumps).
questRecursion11.c = WAP to calculate a raised to the power b.
questRecursion12.c = WAP for Maze Path (also known as Grid) (Condition : One Step at a time, can only move Right and Down).
questRecursion13.c = This question is basically used to clear the concept of recursion (This can be very clear by trees).
questRecursion14.c = WAP to print zig-zag (As if Input=1 Output=111, Input=2 Output=2112112, Input=3 Output=321112111232111211123), this is the simple application of the PreInPost concept.
questRecursion15.c = WAP for tower of hanoi.
questRecursion16.c = Recursion With Arrays.
questRecursion17.c = WAP to find the sum of values of an array of integers.
questRecursion18.c =
