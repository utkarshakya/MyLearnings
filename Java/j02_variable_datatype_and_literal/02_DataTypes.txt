Data Types In Java:

1. Primitive Data Types (Intrinsic) -> byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, bool.
2. Non-Primitive Data Types (Derived) -> 

>> Since Java is statically typed language, therefore Variables must be declared before use.

PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES:

1. byte ->  Value ranges from -128 to 127
            Takes 1 byte
            Default value is 0

2. short -> Value ranges from -(2^15) to (2^15)-1
            Takes 2 bytes
            Default value is 0

3. int ->   Value ranges from -(2^31) to (2^31)-1
            Takes 4 bytes
            Default value is 0

4. float -> Value ranges from (see online docs)
            Takes 4 bytes
            Default value is 0.0f

5. long ->  Value ranges from -(2^63) to (2^63)-1
            Takes 8 bytes
            Default value is 0

6. double ->Value ranges from (see online docs)
            Takes 8 bytes
            Default value is 0.0d

7. char ->  Value ranges from 0 to 65535 (2^16-1)
            Takes 2 bytes (because it supports unicode)
            Default value is '\U0000'

8. bool ->  Value can be true or false
            Size depends on JVM
            Default value is False
