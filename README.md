# My Learnings

This repo collects hands-on examples, notes and small projects for languages and technologies I study regularly (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, C, JavaScript, PHP, React, TailwindCSS, etc.). Use it as a study reference or to run small demos locally.

## Repository structure (top-level)

- `Backend/` — Node.js, Express, MongoDB guides and example servers.
  - `03_ExpressJs/` contains an Express example with `index.js` and `package.json`.
- `C/` — C language exercises and data-structures practice.
- `Java/`, `JavaScript/`, `Php/` — language-specific exercises and notes.
- `React/`, `ReactNative/` — small React & React Native example apps.
- `SigmaWebDevelopment/` — assorted web development exercises.
- `TailwindCSS/` — Tailwind examples and configuration.

Each folder usually contains notes (`*.md`) and small runnable examples (`*.js`, `*.c`, etc.). Browse into a folder and open its README or notes for more details.

## Contributing & personal use

This repository is primarily a personal learning collection. Contributions are welcome if they add clear learning value (fixes to notes, improved examples). When contributing:

- Open a small pull request with a clear explanation.
- Keep examples small and well-commented.

If you just want to use the code, feel free to clone and adapt it for your own learning!
