    let div = document.createElement('div')
    div.className = "main";
    div.id = "hU2";
    div.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";
    div.style.color = "black";
    div.style.padding = "30px";
    div.setAttribute("title", "DOM");
    // div.innerText = "Hello, I Am div Created Through DOM By Utkarsh Shakya";
    const textNode = document.createTextNode("Hello, I Am div Created Through DOM By Utkarsh Shakya");
    div.appendChild(textNode);
    // Through above lines we create element and added the class, id, some style
    // and attribute to it and also added the content (here text).
    
    console.log(div);
    // Now, Run The File And See The Output In The Browser Console. Prefer Chrome.

    // Now, you may wonder why we don't get anything on the body of our page? This is because
    // the div is created in the local memory of browser and is not attached to the body.
    // That's why you can see it in console but not the body of the page.
    // Uncomment The below line and see the magic. :)
    // document.body.appendChild(div);

    // Have you noticed we created textNode with createTextNode() method and then append it in div.
    // Why did we do this, I mean we can use simply innerText to add text in div? Yes, we definitely does
    // but innerText work in little complex way, it first search and fetch the text then overwrite it.
    // And using appendChild() it simply overwrite. It is just for optimization.
