// Unlike regular objects, a Map is iterable and works seamlessly with the 'for...of' loop.
// Don't worry we'll discuss maps in details later. Here is simple use.
const map = new Map();
map.set("Immortal", "Bhishma");
map.set("Strong", "Bhima");
map.set("God", "Krishna");
console.log(map); 
// Now using for of loop on maps
for (const element of map) {
    console.log(element);
    // this will print the map elements in array form.
}
// We can also use it like the following way.
for (const [key, value] of map) { // here we use [key, value]
    console.log(`\n${value} is ${key}`);
}
// See the output to see the difference better.
