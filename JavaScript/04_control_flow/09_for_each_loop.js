// forEach loop takes callback function, In callback function we don't specify name of function.
// As you can see above we didn't give name of the function in the above example.


// We can also use arrow function as a callback function.
// Remember we define arrow functions as: let func = () => {};
// Since we don't need to define name, we can make it like the one given below.
coding.forEach((element) => {
    console.log(element);
})

// We can also define function outside and pass it as an argument, like given below.
function see(value){
    console.log(value);
}

// Note, Giving any function as an argument to for each loop, then give it's reference don't call or execute it.
// All Of The Above Given Examples Gives The Same Output, It Just The Way Of Writing Them.
