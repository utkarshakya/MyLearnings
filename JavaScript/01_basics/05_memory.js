// There are two types of memory in Javascript.
// 1. Stack (Used By Primitive DataTypes)
// 2. Heap (Used By Non-Primitive DataTypes)

// The main and important thing to remember is that in stack the copy is created when we assign one
// variable having value to another variable so when we change the other variable value it only
// affects it's own value not the value of one which we assign to it but in case of heep variable
// start to referring to the original value so when one variable do any change then it will reflected
// to all others who are referring the to same reference value, this is basically happens because
// stack uses pass-by-value and heep uses pass-by-reference, see below example to get it clear.

// This is an example of how stack memory works, it uses pass-by-value principle.
let name = "Samantha";
let newName = name; // This will create a copy of name and store it in newName.
newName = "Kingpin";
console.log(name, newName);

// This is an example of how heap memory works, it uses pass-by-reference principle.
let user1 = {
  email: "user1@gmail.com",
  upi: "user1@paytm",
}; // This is an object.

let user2 = user1; // It start referring to object not on its copy
user2.email = "user2@gmail.com"; // here I did the change so it actually change the object data
console.log(user1); // Now can see the email has been changed
console.log(user2);
