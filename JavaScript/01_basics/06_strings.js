const phrase = new String("-Hola-Amigo-!"); // This one of the way to define a string using new keyword.
// This will treat the string as an object and provide some additional functionalities.

console.log("\n--------- ORIGINAL STRING ---------");
console.log(phrase);

// --- THERE ARE MANY METHOD OF STRING THAT WE CAN USE, HERE ARE SOME ---

console.log("\n--------- LOWER CASE ---------");
console.log(phrase.toLowerCase());
// Converts the string to lower case.

console.log("\n--------- UPPER CASE ---------");
console.log(phrase.toUpperCase());
// Converts the string to upper case.

console.log("\n--------- SUB-STRING & SLICE ---------");
console.log(phrase.substring(0, 5));
// Returns a sub-string.
// Arguments (start index, end index), end index is excluded.

console.log(phrase.slice(0, 5));
console.log(phrase.slice(-6, -1));
// Similar to substring additionally we can use negative index here.

console.log("\n--------- INDEX OF SPECIFIC CHARACTER ---------");
console.log(phrase.indexOf("-"));
console.log(phrase.indexOf("A"));
console.log(phrase.indexOf("a"));
// Returns the index of the specific character.
// If the given character present at many places in string it'll return the index of its first occurrence.
// Also note that this method is case-sensitive.

console.log("\n--------- CHARACTER AT SPECIFIC INDEX ---------");
console.log(phrase.charAt(6));
console.log(phrase.charAt(1));
// Returns the character at specific index.

console.log("\n--------- REPLACE ---------");
console.log(phrase.replace("-", " "));
console.log(phrase.replace(/-/g, " ")); // ***IMPORTANT***
// Returns the string after replacing the specific character or substring from the string.
// Note it method will not replace all occurrences of a specific character or substring.
// Above first example '-' is replaced by an space ' ' but only the first one, see the output.
// In the second example we use something called a Regular Expression as /expression/.
// In regular expression we can use flags, the g flag used after the expression is for global
// search, this will replace all occurrences of a specified expression.
// There are other flags like i is used to make the expression case-insensitive.
// Check this docs on mdn to know more --> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags

console.log("\n--------- INCLUDES ---------");
console.log(phrase.includes("Amigo"));
console.log(phrase.includes("ping"));
// Returns true or false if the given substring or character is present in the searching string.
// We can also give position from where we start searching, if not given it starts from 0 i.e. from starting.

console.log("\n--------- SPLIT ---------");
console.log(phrase.split("-", 2));
console.log(phrase.split("-"));
// Returns an array of values splitted by a given character known as separator.
// We can also limit the values like we did in the first example above

let newString = "   Hola \n\n";
console.log(`\n--------- TRIM, TRIM-START & TRIM-END ---------`);
console.log(`--- HERE ORIGINAL STRING IS ---`);
console.log(newString);
console.log(`--- FROM HERE WE USE METHODS ---`);
console.log(newString.trim());
console.log(newString.trimStart());
console.log(newString.trimEnd());
// Returns the string after removing the leading and trailing white spaces and line terminator characters.
// trimStart() will remove leading white spaces and line terminators only.
// trimEnd() will remove trailing white spaces and line terminators only.
